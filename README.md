# Hacker News - React/Apollo App
This app is following a tutorial for how to use Apollo with React.
[Tutorial Link](https://www.howtographql.com/react-apollo/1-getting-started/)

Goal - learn how to use react/redux with apollo to make graphql calls.

## Graphql server
Stood up a little graphql server to provide the endpoint for our app.  See [Running an Express GraphQL Server](http://graphql.org/graphql-js/running-an-express-graphql-server/)

To run server:
>$:cd graphqlServer

>$:npm run dev

http://localhost:4000/graphql
